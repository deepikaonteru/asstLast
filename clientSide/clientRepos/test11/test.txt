You may think you're hot stuff, the Fred Astaire of this topic — but if you're Fred Astaire, I'm Ginger Rogers: Anything you can do, I can do — backwards, without looking, and in high heels.

You're a computer systems engineer? Wow! Have you publicly called out the CEO of Intel for the untrustability of their encryption blackbox silicon? Have you explained at an ELI5 level the feasibility and utility of peer-to-peer communications network routing? How about explaining fast fourier transforms to a college kid? These are just the things in computer science I've been gilded for. That doesn't count the parts where I picked up the comment of an actual climate scientist that demolishes every single claim made in your oldest gilded comment. Or the two years worth of reddit gold other people gifted me just for being the flagbearer of that comment. That doesn't cover where I kneecapped a transphobe's Loaded Question in an AMA in r/science. Oh, and then there was the one where I explained morphological diversity and the evolutionary basis of intelligence in Aves and Mammalia.

And those are just the gilded comments.

That doesn't cover the comments where I haven't been gilded, like when I shredded the methodology of a trash poll conducted to produce misleading public support figures on the question of whether trans people ahould be allowed to use a restroom.

The thing is, that once someone has been a scientist, they never stop being a scientist. They never stop thinking rationally and critically. They tear apart obvious bullshit with ease after years of doing peer review with actual scientists, after working with their advisors and departments to produce a worthwhile and defensible doctoral thesis, even.

Your most recent gilded comment is a regurgitation of a Stormfront / White Supremacist blogosphere talking-points memo, which in turn was based on a bullshit misread of a statistical publication, by conflating causation with correlation.

And no, my capslock key isn't stuck; I prised it off my keyboard two decades ago so that I would have to be cognisant of holding Shift with my pinky while typing, so that I wouldn't accidentally hose up Windows 2000 source code. Every capitalised letter I write is intentional.
